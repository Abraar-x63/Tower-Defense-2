# Tower-Defense-2

### We want to pay homage to the golden age of arcade games by making a **Tower Defense** game in Java for our our **SWE 223 (OOPL)** project. This repository is the code-base for the game. It is *cross-platform*, playable in Windows, Mac, and Linux.

**TD** is [subgenre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_genre) of [strategy games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_video_game) where the goal is to *defend a player's territories* by *stopping enemies* from reaching the exits, achieved by *placing defensive structures* along their path of attack. 

Here are some features of our game :

- Waves of Incoming Enemies.
- Player-placed obstructions that can damage or kill enemy attackers before they destroy the base.
- Ability to upgrade obstructions
- Some sort of currency (Earned by the defeat of an attacking unit) with which player can purchase towers and upgrades
- Each wave usually has a set number and types of enemies
- Unlock new maps and levels

Many tower defense games come from indie developers and are free to play. Here are a few popular games in the genre that we are inspired by :

1. ***Bloons Tower Defense* (2007)**: [https://ninjakiwi.com/Games/Tower-Defense/Bloons-Tower-Defense-5.html](https://ninjakiwi.com/Games/Tower-Defense/Bloons-Tower-Defense-5.html). The idea is to stop balloons from traveling down a course with towers and monkeys.
2. ***Plants vs. Zombies* (2009)**: In *Plants vs. Zombies*, you play as a homeowner who is attacked by roaming zombies. To defend yourself, you have to plant plants that have various offensive attributes.
3. ***Element TD* (2020)**: This game uses tower defense systems that let you put various items together to provide different offensive and defensive options.

We were initially following a reference from [Kaarin Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1At_c5rKyxH4aWgGPqsRDg)'s code. For detailed explaination and the it, visit [Tutorials](https://www.kaaringaming.com/tutorials). It became very cumbersome as it had 14+ hours of tutorials. We finally decided not to mimic it, but make a game of our own.
